As a bookworm, honestly, the products of my company are pretty good. It has fantastic reading experience and millions of online books. Also, you can get tons of free ebooks over online library and even upload your own ebooks without hacking the device. The overall quality beats Kindle and it has unique waterproof technique. 

Today is the first day to launch audiobooks which is a revolution of ebook readers. All the best to its future!
