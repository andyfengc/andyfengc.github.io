# Introduction
`XAML` stands for Extensible Application Markup Language. Its a simple and declarative language based on XML.
- In XAML, it very easy to create, initialize, and set properties of objects with hierarchical relations.    
- It is mainly used for designing GUIs, however it can be used for other purposes as well, e.g., to declare workflow in Workflow Foundation.
XAML文件会由专门的解析器处理，编译成内部代码，再与c#代码link并编译，最后生成app。
