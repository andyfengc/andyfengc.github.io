# Introduction
`Redis` is an open source, advanced key-value store and an apt solution for building highperformance, scalable web applications. It is often referred to as a data structure server, since the keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets and sorted sets. Redis is written in C. 

Major peculiarities:

- Redis holds its database entirely in the memory, using the disk only for persistence.
- Redis has a relatively rich set of data types when compared to many key-value data stores.
- Redis can replicate data to any number of slaves.
