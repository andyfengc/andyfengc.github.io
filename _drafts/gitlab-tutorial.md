# Introduction #
`Git` is a source code versioning system that lets you locally track changes and push or pull changes from remote resources.

`GitLab, GitHub, and Bitbucket` are services that provide remote access to Git repositories. In addition to hosting your code, the services provide additional features designed to help manage the software development lifecycle.

> `GitHub` is a publicly available, free service which requires all code (unless you have a paid account) be made open. Anyone can see code you push to GitHub and offer suggestions for improvement. 
> `GitLab` is a github like service that organizations can use to provide internal management of git repositories. It is a self hosted Git-repository management system that keeps the user code private and can easily deploy the changes of the code.
