# Introduction
drill bit 钻头用来在不同材料上钻洞，常见材料包括木头、金属、塑料、瓷砖、混凝土、瓷器等，广义来说，钻头可用于steel不锈钢, aluminum铝, copper铜, cast iron铁, sheet metal钣金, fiberglass玻璃纤维, brick砖, vinyl flooring乙烯基地板等等.

钻头有两个主要部件: shank and chuck.

shank是钻头的一端，放入chuck中进行固定。shank可能有圆形或者hex(常见1/4inch)，圆形的更容易居中放正，hex的则chuck抓取力更好一些。
>  SDS (slotted drive system开槽驱动系统) shanks 用于 concrete drills and demolition bits and work specifically with SDS-Plus and SDS-Max rotary hammer drills.

chuck是电钻的一部分，用来固定钻头。大部分家用电钻使用3/8-inch or 1/2-inch chuck，大型电钻（譬如heavyduty或工业用的）会用到 5/8-inch and 3/4-inch

# 钻头材质和涂层Materials and Finishes
1. High-Speed Steel (HSS)高速钢 drill bits are used for drilling wood, light metals, fiberglass and PVC. 通常银白色，没有涂层

1. Black oxide-coated高碳钢 drill bits are more durable than standard HSS bits and the coating helps the drill bit resist rust. These are best for hardwood, softwood, PVC, fiberglass and steel. 通常灰黑色，表面经过氧化处理，寿命比普通高速钢提高1.5倍

1. Titanium-coated drill bits 钛钻头 have reduced friction, require less effort and last longer than black oxide-coated bits. These are best for hardwood, softwood, PVC, fiberglass and steel. 通常金色的钛镀层和银色混合，适合高温工作

1. Cobalt drill bits 钴钻头 are used for drilling hard metal and steel. They dissipate heat quickly and are highly resistant to abrasions, making them better for drilling into hard metals than black oxide- or titanium-coated drill bits. When considering a cobalt drill bit vs titanium, cobalt bits are usually the best drill bits for stainless steel. 通常整体琥珀色

1. Carbide-tipped drill bits stay very sharp over long periods of use and are used mainly for concrete, tile and masonry. These are often the best masonry drill bits for your project.

1. Bi-metal drill bits are useful for a range of materials like light metal, wood and PVC; bi-metal drill bits cut fast and smooth with greatly reduced vibrations.

1. Diamond drill bits are ideal for cutting into glass, sea glass, fused glass, rocks and minerals.

1. Alloy steel drill bits 合金钢钻头 are typically used in machine shops for cutting sheet metal of varying thicknesses. These are often the best drill bits for metal if you're working exclusively with thin materials.
