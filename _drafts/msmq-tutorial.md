# Introduction #
Microsoft Message Queuing (`MSMQ`) is a message queue implementation developed by Microsoft and deployed in its Windows Server operating systems. `MSMQ` technology is used for asynchronous communication using messages. It provides a distributed and decoupled way of sending and receiving messages between applications.

`MSMQ` technology enables applications running at different times to communicate across heterogeneous networks and systems that may be temporarily offline. Applications send messages to queues and read messages from queues. The following illustration shows how a queue can hold messages that are generated by multiple sending applications and read by multiple receiving applications.

MSMQ is a messaging allows two or more applications to send messages to each other without having to immediately know the results. It is developed for the Windows Operating System, and acts as a queue manager that assists you in sending serialized objects to the queue where they will stay until you receive them. MSMQ allows you to interact between remote machines, even over the Internet in a decoupled way.
