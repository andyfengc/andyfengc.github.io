## Staple
Staples are often described as `X/Y`. have two reference numbers that are normally standard throughout the brands. Sometimes, there are exceptions to the rules.

1. first number X is the gauge of the wire, the thickness. i.e. 24/## or 26/##
2. The second number Y is the length of the shank (leg) in millimeters

Common sizes for the home and office include: 26/6, 24/6, 24/8, 13/6, 13/8 and No. 10 for mini staplers. Common sizes for heavy duty staplers include: 23/8, 23/12, 23/15, 23/20, 23/24, 13/10, and 13/14.
> The most popular staple for office staplers is the 26/6. A standard 6mm staple.

# Staple gun (powered stapler)
A staple gun or powered stapler is a hand-held machine used to drive heavy metal staples into wood, plastic, or masonry. Staple guns are used for many different applications and to affix a variety of materials, including insulation, house wrap, roofing, wiring, carpeting, upholstery, and hobby and craft materials.

Types by power source:

1. manual

> Power staple guns can set staples at a somewhat quicker rate than hand-powered models, but their main advantage is that they can be used continuously for hours with comparatively little fatigue.

## Staple
For most purposes square end staples are used; but some staplers can take rounded end staples for holding cables against a surface.

### staple wire
staple wire means the staples wire dimensions. We can divide the staple wires into the following three categories, fine wire, medium wire, and heavy wire — all with their specific uses for different applications.

1. Fine wire
	Fine wire staples are the thinnest type of staples. It is for delicate applications where the staple needs to be discrete with low visibility and where the back of the staple should be unexposed. Fine wire staples are the most common type for upholstery and framing because it has a minimal effect when attaching fabric (textiles) to wood or plastic. And it is the go-to wire when you work with breathable membrane or vinyl.

	![](/images/posts/20220130-stapler-9.jpg)
	
	Applications: Furniture Upholstery, Vinyl, and trim, Picture frames, Automotive upholstery, Labeling

1. Medium wire
	
	A medium wire staple is an excellent staple for upholstery, but compared to a fine wire staple, it produces more holding power. This type of staple has a superb wood on wood joining capability and is therefore often used in manufacturing where the fine wire staple is not enough. The medium wire is also widely used when joining with plastic.

	![](/images/posts/20220130-stapler-10.jpg)

	Applications: Furniture, Pallet, Crate, Sheathing, Subflooring, Packaging

1. Heavy wire

	The heavy wire staple is the thickest type of staple and is the one to use when the job demands a robust staple. Due to its thickness, it takes up a more substantial area when used compared to its fine and medium wire counterparts. But it provides higher holding power and is excellent when joining on wood or plastic on thick surfaces. The heavy wire is often you in house construction and in applications where you need a really robust joining.

	Applications: Furniture framework, Roof shingles, House manufacturing, Packaging

Guage: Many manufacturers state the wire diameter in the measurement gauge. The higher the gauge number is, the thinner the wire is, the lower the gauge is the thicker the wire. See below how the gauge number relates to the wire type.

### staple crown
The staple crown is the top middle part of the staples holding the two legs together. There are three types of crowns (narrow crown, medium crown, wide crown), and they all have their capabilities and uses.

1. Narrow Crown

	The narrow crown is the smallest type of crown. It is easy to hide in applications after joining. It covers a smaller area then medium and wide crown staples. Often used for finish and trim and other delicate jobs, but it is also great for wood and panel work. A great choice when you want to save raw material and cut manufacturing costs.
	
	![](/images/posts/20220130-stapler-13.jpg)

	Applications: Molding, Cabinets, Trim, Paneling, Drawers, Upholstery, Giftboxes, Fruitboxes

	approx 1/4" wide, the wire gauge is thinner (18 gauge) to prevent splitting the wood in the finish applications. 

1. Medium Crown

	The medium crown is as its name the crown type that comes in between narrow and wide crown staples. Used when you need to cover a larger area on your material than narrow crown allows you to do. It has more uses than a narrow crown staple and is often used in home construction.
	
	![](/images/posts/20220130-stapler-14.jpg)
	
	Applications: Furniture, Pallet, Crate, Sheathing, Subflooring, Packaging, Roof sheathing, OSB/plywood sheathing on th ewalls of a newly framed home

	it is used for more rough construction applications where more holding power is required from the staple. The staple is wider (either 7/16" or 1/2") than the narrow crown and the wire gauge is thicker (16 gauge).

1. Wide Crown

	Of all the crown widths, this is the broadest crown type. Wide crown staples have a lot of similar uses as medium crown staples. When esthetics is not as necessary, a wide crown staple is a great choice. It covers a large area then narrow and medium crowns. Josef Kihlbergs wide crown staples are made for carton closing.
	
	![](/images/posts/20220130-stapler-15.jpg)
	
	Applications: Carton closing, Packaging, heavy-duty use in construction

	projects in truss building, housewrap, roofing, lathing and more. Look to use a wide crown stapler for many of the same applications as a medium crown, but where it doesn't matter if the staple affects the appearance of your project. Wide crown staples are bulkier, but offer greater holding capability. Wide crown staples are bulkier, but offer greater holding capability.

	crown could be 5/8, 3/4, 7/8, 1, 1-1/4, 1-1/2, 1-3/4, 2 in

> narrow crown and medium crown is enough for DIY use.

### staple leg
There a quit a few leg sizes for the same crown size. 

How to select the right leg size?

The thickness or density of the material you are fastening determines what leg length you should use for your application. 

1. `Standard rule` is to take the thickness of the material your fastening and multiply it by three, or the closest shorter leg length. So if the material you are fastening is 6mm thick, you should go with a staple length of 18mm.

	![](/images/posts/20220130-stapler-14.png)

1. `Thin material`. If your application is using fabric or other thin material, we recommend adding 4mm to the thickness of the material used. So if your material is 3 mm thick, you use 7mm leg length.
	
	![](/images/posts/20220130-stapler-16.jpg)

1. `Hard material`. To get a robust joining when fastening to hard materials such as hardwood, we recommend using a staple with leg lengths twice as long as the material that needs fastening.

### Staple point
The staple point is the first part of the staple coming in contact with the fastening material. The staple points come in various designs, where all are specialized to provide the correct holding power for the application. Usually, we use the most common design, the chisel point design.

A chisel point staple has the design of the letter V, where the two flat inclined side meets at a sharp angle. The design makes it possible to drive the staple straight into the material to the crown of the staple.

### staple material
1. Galvanized staples
	A galvanized staple is the most common staple type. The staple is a steel staple that is coated with a layer of zinc to be able to handle general corrosion better. A galvanized staple is comparable in strength and appearance to a stainless steel staple. If you need an all-around staple with a long life expectancy, a galvanized staple could be the right choice for your application.

	![](/images/posts/20220130-stapler-19.jpg)
	
	At Josef Kihlberg, we produce premium galvanized staples that do not compromise the quality, which means that the staple has the correct holding power for the application and has the proper life expectancy.

2. Copper coated staples
	Copper coated staples are one of the best choices when it comes to beautiful clean aesthetics. It is excellent for transport packaging due to it works better than regular steel in non-humidity-controlled environments. Copper coated staples can oxidate faster in situations that are salty, hot, and acidic. It is the go-to staple for carton closing.

	![](/images/posts/20220130-stapler-20.jpg)
	
	For the best copper-coated staples, there should be a certain amount of copper coating. We perfected this in our copper-coated staples. So you get premium quality staples that can handle the material, and that does the job for your application.

3. Aluminum staples
	An aluminum staple is excellent for applications that need to avoid magnetism. The corrosion protection is more significant than a galvanized staple but has less corrosion protection than a stainless steel staple. Another great benefit of an aluminum staple is that you can easily cut through it without hurting your tool. Therefore it is widely used by sawmills when cutting trough wood.

	![](/images/posts/20220130-stapler-21.jpg)

1. Stainless steel staples

	A Stainless steel staple is for applications that need a higher level of corrosion protection or need to have a higher protection against heat. The standard stainless steel staples are 304 & 316. The 304 stainless steel staple is used for both indoor and outdoor use and protects against corrosion from milder oxidizing acids. The 316 stainless steel staple gives even greater protection against corrosion and is common when the application comes in contact with salty environments. A stainless steel staple is also a great choice in applications that need to look modern and high quality. A stainless steel staple is an environmental friendly staple, it breaks down by itself in nature, giving back important minerals to earth.

# staple gun vs office stapler
Unlike office staplers, most staple guns lack an anvil, the metal plate with curved slots that office staplers use to bend the legs of the staple inwards or outwards and flatten them against the paper.

# FAQ
## What Are T50 Staples?
A “T50” is a standard in staples. They are actually the best-selling staple type in the world. The T50 staple is compatible it an Arrow T50 staple gun, as well as any number of other staplers sold by companies like Stanley, Craftsman, Dewalt, etc.

A T50 is a heavy-duty staple meant for construction staples, which includes insulation, roofing materials, carpeting, upholstery, and similar applications. This sort of staple is not appropriate for office and household use as it’s too large and tough for paper products. These staples are even tough enough to go through light trim materials, provider the stapler is strong enough.

The most popular stapler to use with the T50 is the Arrow T50 staple gun, which is an all-metal, manual stapler which has been made since the 1950s

## What Size Is A T50 Staple?
A T50 staple is defined by its flat top (the “crown”) which is 10mm wide (3/8″).

The staples then come in a wide variety of lengths including:
