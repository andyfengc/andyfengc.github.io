# Introduction
The Instagram Graph API is a standard REST API that supports basic CRUD operations.

The Instagram Graph API is built on the Graph API, so its endpoints consist of nodes, edges on those nodes, and fields.

- Nodes are your basic objects, such as individual users, photos, and comments.
- Edges are connections between objects, and are typically used to return all of the objects connected to a single object (node).
- Fields are properties on an object, and you can often specify which fields you want returned by the API.
