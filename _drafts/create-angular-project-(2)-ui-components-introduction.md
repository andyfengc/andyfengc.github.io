## Overview ##
As an open and great framework, Angular has been supported by lots of communities and many component-based libraries was developed. By introducing them into our projects, we could speed up our development with better user experience and maintainability.

Here are some popular UI libraries and frameworks for UI development in Angular:

-	[Angular Material](https://material.angular.io ): Offical Material components library - 
-	[Covalent](https://teradata.github.io/covalent/#/components): An open-source UI framework built on Angular & Angular Material

Considering on our requirements:

1. Open source project
2. Easy to learn, modify and integrate
3. Rich, good-looking and maintainable UI components
4. Long-term support and improvements
5. Unlimited further development
6. License permission for commercial usage

Below projects won't be under our consideration because of following issues:

- Commercial license required:
	- Kendo UI
	- Webix
	- Ag-grid
	- FancyGrid
	- DevExtreme
	- Amexio

- Limited UI components
	- ngx-bootstrap

- Technical concerns       
	- ngx-datatable
	- PrimeNG

Therefore, the choice could be **Angular Material + Covalent** or **Angular UI**. Both of them are using [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT ) and it allows commercial use, modification, distribution and private use. Also, they have rich components and maintained by dozens of contributors. 

Here are some online demos for these two libraries:

-	[Covalent demos](https://teradata.github.io/covalent/#/components): 
-	[Angular UI demos](https://angular-ui.github.io) (please click the home button to try for each sub component)
